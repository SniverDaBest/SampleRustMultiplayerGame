# What is this?
This is a sample for a multiplayer game written in Rust. It uses TCP for it's connection type, and uses piston_window for it's graphical library. This code is a modified version of an old version of Untitled Pixel Game, a.k.a the game I'm creating.

# Why did you make this?
I have many reasons why I wanted to make this. I will list a few.
- It helps beginners start coding
- It's a good template for a multiplayer game
- It's some code that I can just copy and paste into future projects. You can do the same, but please just put my name into the source code, so you can tell it's mine, and not yours.
